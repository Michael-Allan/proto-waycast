    <h1>Affectively grounding my steps in beauty and emotion</h1>
    <p>
        Here I disclose the works of fine art and literature that motivate my steps.
        Each disclosure is itself an immediate step toward my goal,
        because immediately it casts a public vote of confidence in the effectiveness of the work,
        which gives public recognition to its author, and invites others to improve on it.
