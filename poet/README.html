<h1>Affectively grounding my steps in beauty and emotion</h1>
<p>
    Here I disclose the works of fine art and literature that motivate my steps.
    Each disclosure casts a public vote of confidence on the effectiveness of an author’s work.
    This itself is an immediate step toward my goal,
    because immediately it extends public recognition to the author
    and proffers encouragement to others who might carry the work farther.
    </p>
