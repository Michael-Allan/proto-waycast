<h1>Affectively grounding my steps in beauty and emotion</h1>
<p>
    Here I disclose the works of fine art and literature that motivate my steps.
    Each disclosure casts a public vote of confidence on the effectiveness of an authorâ€™s work.
    This itself is an immediate step toward my goal,
    because immediately it extends public recognition to the author
    and proffers encouragement to others who might carry the work farther.
    </p>
