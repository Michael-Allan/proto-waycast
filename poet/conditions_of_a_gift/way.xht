- narration reworked
    - restated so that other wayscribes can more easily identify with it and adopt it
    - plain
        - without explanatory gloss of its own
        - rather use it as a gloss on the <html:a href='#image'>image</html:a>
    - ending in tears
        - for what the child was unable to express otherwise at the time

       ‘Margie was holding tightly to the string of her beautiful new balloon.
        Suddenly, a gust of wind caught it.  The wind carried it into a tree.
        The balloon hit a branch and burst.  Margie cried and cried.’

    - thus implicitly, vicariously explaining the <html:a href='#remembrance'>remembrance</html:a> too
- story does not go *separately* here under poet/ because:
    - it needs to be inline with the gloss in order to work
    - it must not be copied as a whole work
        - rather only as a quote in a separate context (mine)
        - else the copy would probably need permission
    - it is not a way-motivational work outside of the context in which it's presented
        - so does not belong as such (alone) here under poet/
