    [ part (a) personal experience
        < from http://reluk.ca/project/100-0/poll/c/pipe/100-5/norm.xht#sympathy-for-present-image
        - ending in tears
            - for what the child was unable to express otherwise at the time
        - narration reworked
            - restated so that other wayscripters can more easily identify with it and adopt it
            - plain
                - without explanatory gloss of its own
                - rather use it as a gloss on (b)
    [ part (b) Margie's story
        < from http://reluk.ca/project/100-0/poll/c/pipe/100-5/norm.xht#present-image
        - with explanatory gloss
            ' One|I can understand the reason for her tears ...
            - thus implicitly, vicariously explaining (a) too
        - story does not go *separately* here under poet/ because:
            - it needs to be inline with the gloss in order to work
            - it must not be copied as a whole work
                - rather only as a quote in a separate context (mine)
                - else the copy would probably need permission
            - it is not a way-motivational work outside of the context in which it's presented
                - so does not belong as such (alone) here under poet/
