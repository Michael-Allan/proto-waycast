<M id='M'>
    In continual fear that I am proving unequal to reason’s demands,
    unworthy of my most valued gift, and of the gift giver,
    I realign my means to — so reaffirm that I am equal to —
    securing the endless continuity or full flower of practical reason
    in the existential refuge of great distances
