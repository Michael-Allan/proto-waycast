    <final_goal id='root'>
        The endless continuity or full flower of practical reason
        <means>
            The <html:a way:join='/_institute_rightly.xht#institute_defined'>institution</html:a>
            of a <html:a way:join='/normative_ethic.xht#virtue'>virtue</html:a>
            <step:_ way:join='/_institute_rightly.xht#institute_virtue'/>
            <viability>
                Apparently the institution of a virtue is a fit means to reach the final goal
                <_>
                    An outer, spatial form of the final goal is E
                    <E way:join='/moral_facts.xht#E'/>
                    </_>
                <_>
                    To reach E, apparently it suffices to institute a virtue
                    <_>
                        Instituting a virtue would entail instituting
                        the <html:a way:join='/normative_ethic.xht#virtue'>
                        forms G and F</html:a>
                        </_>
                    <_>
                        The institution of G and F apparently suffices to reach E
                        <_ way:join='/moral_forms.xht#E_from_GF'/>
                        </_>

        I am working toward the final goal, presently at these points
        <!--
          This is my resolve waybit.  It affirms my intention to act toward my final or endmost goal.
          When viewed on the Web, it also lists my active commitments, the points where I am now engaged
          in working the way.  It does this because at those points, which are elsewhere in the waycast,
          I refer back here with lines of wayscript such as this:

            <working way:join='/way.xht#resolve'/>

          And maybe this:

            <doing_it way:join='/way.xht#resolve'/>

          These lines are commitment jointers.  I place them within the larger way declaration
          at precisely those points where I am active.  For more information, see
          http://reluk.ca/project/wayic/script/doc.task § Commitment declaration
