        I am working toward the final goal, presently at these points:
        <!--
          This is my resolve waybit.  It affirms my intention to act toward my final or endmost goal.
          When viewed on the Web, it also lists my active commitments, the points where I am now engaged
          in working the way.  It does this because at those points, which are elsewhere in the waycast,
          I refer back here with lines of waysource such as this:

            <working way:join='/way.xht#resolve'/>

          And maybe this:

            <doing_it way:join='/way.xht#resolve'/>

          These lines are commitment jointers.  I place them within the larger way declaration
          at precisely those points where I am active.  For more information, see
          http://reluk.ca/project/wayic/script/doc.task § Commitment declaration
