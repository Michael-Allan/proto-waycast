<h1>Affording my steps with purpose-built devices</h1>
<p>
    Here are my development plans and designs for devices of the mechanical arts.
    These are purpose-built structures and machines that function at once in the physical and social worlds,
    where they hold open a passage and facilitate my steps toward the goal.
    </p>
