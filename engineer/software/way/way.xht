        ( notebook 2017.8.13 (mostly premature, but not the double circles)
        - open questions conceerning flows of power and text among waycasters
            * how should power flow among waycasters?
            * how should text flow among waycasters?
            * how should these two flows interrelate?

            - wayscripting questions like the following
                - but restated as contraints on the provision of backgrounding
            - questions
                * what does it mean when a person:
                    - defines a variant way?
                    * picks out from the background
                        - from a vast and complex whole
                        - one piece of the way
                        - and changes it?
                * what does it mean when the change includes an extension
                    - increasing the size and complexity of the way?
                * who should learn of such changes?
                    - more specifically
                        * who should learn of my changes?
                        * and whose changes should I learn of?
                * on learning of a change
                    - how should one allow it into his way?
