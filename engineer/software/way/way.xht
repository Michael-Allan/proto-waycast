            * how should power flow among waycasters?
            * how should text flow among waycasters?

                * what does it mean when a person:
                    - defines a variant way?
                    * picks out from the background
                        - from a vast and complex whole
                        - one piece of the way
                        - and changes it?
                * what does it mean when the change includes an extension
                    - increasing the size and complexity of the way?
                * who should learn of such changes?
                    - more specifically
                        * who should learn of my changes?
