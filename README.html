        This is my wayrepo
            <!-- personal property as per engineer/software/way/repo/#ever_F             HERE CUSTOM -->
        — a repository of files that encode my public expressions in regard to personal goals
            <!-- as per engineer/software/way/repo/#public,                         HERE DOWN CUSTOM

        — a frame of self expression, a medium of interpersonal exchange,
          and the structural heart of a dispersive technique of communication that I call ‘waycasting’.
            <!-- see "focused and centered", http://reluk.ca/project/way                 HERE CUSTOM -->
        </p>
    <p>
        You can think of waycasting in the way a programmer might:
        it’s like an interactive Greasemonkey for the ‘world computer’.
        The wayrepo is my user script and I can make it do anything I like.

    <!--
    <p>
        If you haven’t experienced it yet,
        then the thing to watch out for in the metaphor is the interactive part;
        because this kind of user script (wayscript) runs not only in the objective world,
        but in the subjective, too, where its changes are felt immediately.
        So you won’t come out of it unchanged. — But then, neither will the objective world.
        </p>
        this now seems unhelpful
