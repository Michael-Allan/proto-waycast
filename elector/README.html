    <h1>Disclosing my ballot intentions</h1>
    <p>
        Here I disclose the votes that I intend to cast in future elections.
        Each disclosed vote is itself an immediate step toward my goal,
        because immediately it gives help to the official candidate who I think would best help me, if elected
        — whether as a <a href='../lawmaker/'>legislator</a>, or <a href='../kingmaker/'>executive</a> —
        and stakes a claim on that help in advance.
        </p>
