<h1>Disclosing my ballot intentions</h1>
<p>
    Here I disclose the votes that I intend to cast in future elections.
    Each disclosed vote is itself an immediate step toward my goal,
    because immediately it gives help to the official candidate who I think would best help me if elected
    — whether as a <a href='../lawmaker/'>legislator</a>, or <a href='../kingmaker/'>executive</a> —
    and stakes a claim on that help in advance.
    </p>
