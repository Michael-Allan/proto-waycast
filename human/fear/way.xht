            Practical reason implies ‘heaven in corporeal’

        <t>
            The offer of practical reason is written in the night sky like a covenant
            <t>
                Ever expanding through the stars, out beyond the light barrier,

                    <t>
                        Our kind is a rational nature, distinguishable from others in the rest of nature

                To accept the possibility of such an existence, and to hold on to it,
