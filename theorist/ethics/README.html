<h1>Moral theory</h1> <!-- though "ethics" is commonly a general term for morality or moral philosophy
  (the study of morals), this is directory /theorist/ethics/ and its particular concern is theory -->
<p>
    Here I aim to salvage my hope for the future
    from its wreckage in the abyssal universe,<sup>1</sup>
    summon all that matters to me <sup>2</sup>
    and reconstruct a moral cosmos.<sup>3</sup>

        Hope is <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/100-0/poll/c/pipe/100-5/norm.xht#vacuum-stability'>wrecked</a>
        on the electroweak vacuum theory of physics.
        I aim to salvage it with a subject-object pairing of postulates,
        namely <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/100-0/poll/c/pipe/100-5/norm.xht#postulate-T'>T</a>
        interacting with <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/100-0/poll/c/pipe/100-5/norm.xht#postulate-S'>S</a>.

        Adding a value postulate
        <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/100-0/poll/c/pipe/100-5/norm.xht#postulate-R'>R</a>,
        I infer a ‘<a href='http://reluk.ca/project/100-0/poll/c/pipe/100-5/norm.xht#M'>moral matter</a>’.

        Abstracting from the matter, I
        recover a <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/100-0/poll/c/pipe/100-5/norm.xht#Form'>pair of forms</a>,
        test their <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/100-0/poll/c/pipe/100-5/norm.xht#Fitness'>integrity</a>,
        and build from them
        a <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/wayrepo/theorist/ethics/normative_ethic/way.xht'>normative ethic</a>.
