<h1>Plugging myself into a structure of enactive power</h1>
<p>
    Here I formally choose my leaders and peers in action.
    I place myself within a hierarchy of independent, volunteer actors
    — one among several such structures that compete for members —
    thereby offering my support to a select group in a bid for their support in return.
    I think this will help me advance toward my goal.
    </p>
<p>
    More, it invites candidates for elected office
    to bid for a shift in <a href='../elector/'>my electoral vote</a>
    by plugging themselves into the same power structure.
    This would amount to several things: a formal pledge to give their help once elected;
    a precise indication of the channels in which the help would be directed;
    and, while they remain plugged in and active, evidence of their sincerity.
    They might thereby begin to attract the electoral votes of other members, including mine.
    </p>
