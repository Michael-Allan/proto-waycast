    <h1>Plugging myself into an executive power structure</h1>
    <p>
        Here I formally choose my leaders and peers in action.
        I place myself within a de facto, volunteer power structure — an organization of volunteers —
        thereby offering my support to others in a bid for their support in return.
        I think this will help me advance toward my goal.

        Further, it invites candidates for elected office
        to bid for <a href='../elector/'>my electoral vote</a> — to formally pledge their help once elected —
        by immediately plugging themselves into the same, volunteer power structure.
        </p>
