<h1>Plugging myself into an executive power structure</h1>
<p>
    Here I formally choose my leaders and peers in action.
    I place myself within a de facto, volunteer power structure — an organization of volunteers —
    thereby offering my support to others in a bid for their support in return.
    I think this will help me advance toward my goal.
    </p>
<p>
    Further, it invites candidates for elected office
    to bid for <a href='../elector/'>my electoral vote</a> — to formally pledge their help once elected —
    by immediately plugging themselves into the same, volunteer power structure.
    </p>
