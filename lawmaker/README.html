<h1>Disclosing my ballot-cum-legislative intentions</h1>
<p>
    Here I predict which proposed bills would best help to advance my goal, if they became law.
    Each prediction is itself an immediate step toward my goal:
    first, in casting a public vote of confidence for the proposed bill;
    and second, in thereby inviting candidates for office to bid for a shift
    in <a href='../elector/'>my electoral vote</a> — to formally pledge their help once elected —
    by casting <em>like</em> votes of confidence for the same bill.
    </p>
