    <h1>Disclosing my ballot-cum-legislative intentions</h1>
    <p>
        Here I predict which proposed bills would best help to advance my goal, if they became law.
        Each prediction is itself an immediate step toward my goal,
        because immediately it casts a public vote of confidence for the proposed bill,
        and invites candidates for office to bid for <a href='../elector/'>my electoral vote</a>
        — to formally pledge their help once elected —
        by casting <em>like</em> votes of confidence for the same, or a similar bill.
        </p>
